# Technique H28: Providing definitions for abbreviations by using the abbr element

## About this Technique

This technique relates to [3.1.4: Abbreviations](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/abbreviations) (Advisory).

This technique applies to HTML.

## Description

The objective of this technique is to provide expansions or definitions for abbreviations by using the abbr element. It is always appropriate to use the abbr element for any abbreviation, including acronyms and initialisms.

This technique has been altered from a sufficient technique to an advisory technique because it uses the title attribute of abbr to provide the expansion of the abbreviation needed to achieve a sufficient technique when used in combination with [G102](../general/G102). As noted in the [specification](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/dom.html#the-title-attribute):

Relying on the title attribute is currently discouraged as many user agents do not expose the attribute in an accessible manner as required by this specification (e.g., requiring a pointing device such as a mouse to cause a tooltip to appear, which excludes keyboard-only users and touch-only users, such as anyone with a modern phone or tablet).

## Examples

### Example 1: Using abbr element to expand abbreviations

```html
<p>Sugar is commonly sold in 5 <abbr title="pound">lb.</abbr> bags.</p>
<p>Welcome to the <abbr title="World Wide Web">WWW</abbr>!</p>
```

### Example 2: Using dfn and abbr element to define abbreviations

```html
<p>Tasini 
  <dfn id="etal"><abbr title="and others">et al.</abbr></dfn>
  <abbr title="versus">v.</abbr>
  The New York Times <abbr title="and others">et al.</abbr> is the landmark lawsuit 
  brought by members of the National Writers Union against ...
</p>
```

### Example 3: Using the abbr element to expand an acronym

```html
<p>Recent updates to the <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> color module ...</p>
```

### Example 4:  Using the abbr element to expand an initialism

```html
<p><abbr title="British Broadcasting Corporation">BBC</abbr></p>
```
