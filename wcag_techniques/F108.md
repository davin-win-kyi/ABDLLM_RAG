# Technique F108: Failure of Success Criterion 2.5.7 Dragging Movements due to not providing a single pointer method that does not require a dragging movement

## About this Technique

This technique relates to [2.5.7: Dragging Movements](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/dragging-movements) (Failure).

This failure applies to content using any technology which supports pointer input.

## Description

The objective of this failure is to avoid situations in which people with motor impairments who cannot operate content because the only way to actuate a function is by dragging a target element from its initial position to some other position. The failure occurs when there is no alternative single pointer input available to actuate the function. The alternative may involve a series of single pointer interactions (for example, activating a target to be moved; opening a dropdown menu; and selecting a drop destination from the list of menu items offered).

## Examples

### Example 1: List re-ordering

A list of items can be re-ordered by picking up an item and dragging it upwards or downwards. Other elements move dynamically to open a gap where the picked-up target can be dropped. There is no alternative way to re-order the list that can be executed via a [single pointer](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-single-pointer) input.

### Example 2: Kanban board

In a Kanban implementation for process management, tasks can be dragged horizontally across from one ‘swimming lane’ to another in order to change the status of tasks (for example, to change the status of a task from “in process” to “completed”). There is no alternative way to move targets between lanes that can be executed via a [single pointer](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-single-pointer) input.

## Tests

### Procedure

1. Check the interface for the presence of functions triggered by [dragging movements](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-dragging-movements)
2. Check that there is a [single pointer](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-single-pointer) input alternative to operate the same function

### Expected Results

* If #2 is false, then this failure condition applies and the content fails this Success Criterion.
