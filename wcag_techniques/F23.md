# Technique F23: Failure of 1.4.2 due to playing a sound longer than 3 seconds where there is no mechanism to turn it off

## About this Technique

This technique relates to [1.4.2: Audio Control](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/audio-control) (Failure).

This failure applies to all technologies except those for voice interaction.

## Description

This describes a failure condition for Success Criteria involving sound. If sound does not turn off automatically within 3 seconds and there is no way to turn the sound off, independently from the overall system volume level, then Success Criterion 1.4.2 would not be met. The sound would fall within this failure condition.

## Examples

### Example 1

* A site that plays continuous background music

### Example 2

* A site with a narrator that lasts more than 3 seconds before stopping, and there is no mechanism to stop it.

## Tests

### Procedure

1. Check that there is a mechanism, independent from the overall system volume control, to turn off any sound that plays automatically for more than three seconds.

### Expected Results

* If check #1 is not true then content fails Success Criterion 1.4.2
