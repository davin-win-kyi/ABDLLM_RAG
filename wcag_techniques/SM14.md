# Technique SM14: Providing sign language interpretation through synchronized video
   streams in SMIL 2.0

## About this Technique

This technique relates to [1.2.6: Sign Language (Prerecorded)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/sign-language-prerecorded) (Sufficient when used with [G81: Providing a synchronized video of the sign language interpreter that can be displayed in a different viewport or overlaid on the image by the player](../general/G81)).

This technique applies to SMIL 2.0.

## Description

The objective of this technique is to provide a way for people who are deaf or otherwise have trouble hearing the dialogue in audio visual material to be able to view the material. With this technique all of the dialogue and important sounds are available in a sign-language interpretation video that is displayed in a caption area.

With SMIL 2.0, separate regions can be defined for the two videos. The two video playbacks are synchronized, with the content video displayed in one region of the screen, while the corresponding sign-language interpretation video is displayed in another region.

## Examples

### Example 1: SMIL 2.0 sign-language video sample for RealMedia player

```xml
<smil xmlns="https://www.w3.org/2001/SMIL20/Language">
<head>
  <layout>
    <root-layout backgroundColor="black" height="310" width="330"/>
    <region id="video" backgroundColor="black" top="5" left="5" 
     height="240" width="320"/>
    <region id="signing" backgroundColor="black" top="250" 
     height="60" left="5" width="320"/>
  </layout>
</head>
<body>
  <par>
    <video src="salesdemo.mpg" region="video" title="Sales Demo" 
     alt="Sales Demo"/>
    <video src="salesdemo_signing.mpg" 
     region="signing" systemCaptions="on" 
     title="sign language interpretation" 
     alt="Sales Demo Sign Language Interpretation"/>
  </par>
</body>
</smil>
```

The example shows a par segment containing two video tags. The systemCaptions attribute indicates that the sign language video should be displayed when the user's player setting for captions indicates the preference for captions to be displayed. The layout section defines the regions used for the main video and the sign language interpretation video.
