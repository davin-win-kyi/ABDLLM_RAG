# Technique H57: Using the language attribute on the HTML element

## About this Technique

This technique relates to [3.1.1: Language of Page](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/language-of-page) (Sufficient).

This technique applies to HTML.

## Description

The objective of this technique is to identify the default language of a document by providing the lang attribute on the html element.

Identifying the language of the document is important for a number of reasons:

* It allows braille translation software to substitute control codes for accented characters, and insert control codes necessary to prevent erroneous creation of Grade 2 braille contractions.
* Speech synthesizers that support multiple languages will be able to orient and adapt to the pronunciation and syntax that are specific to the language of the page, speaking the text in the appropriate accent with proper pronunciation.
* Marking the language can benefit future developments in technology, for example users who are unable to translate between languages themselves will be able to use machines to translate unfamiliar languages.
* Marking the language can also assist user agents in providing definitions using a dictionary.

## Examples

### Example 1: Defining the content of an HTML document to be in French

```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="fr">
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <title>document écrit en français</title>
</head>
<body>
  ... document écrit en français ...
</body>
</html>
```

## Tests

### Procedure

Examine the html element of the document.

1. Check that the html element has a lang attribute.
2. Check that the value of the lang attribute conforms to [BCP 47: Tags for Identifying Languages; Matching of Language Tags](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/bcp47) or its successor and reflects the primary language used by the web page.

### Expected Results

* Checks #1 and #2 are true.
