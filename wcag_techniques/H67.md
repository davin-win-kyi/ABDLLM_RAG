# Technique H67: Using null alt text and no title attribute on img elements for images that assistive technology should ignore

## About this Technique

This technique relates to [1.1.1: Non-text Content](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/non-text-content) (Sufficient).

This technique applies to HTML documents that load images.

## Description

The purpose of this technique is to show how images can be marked so that they can be ignored by assistive technology.

If no title attribute is used, and the alt text is set to null (i.e., alt="") it indicates to assistive technology that the image can be safely ignored.

Note

Having a "null" alt attribute is not the same as having no alt attribute.

## Examples

### Example 1: Inserting a decorative image on a web page

```html
<img alt="" src="squiggle.gif" height="20" width="20">
```
