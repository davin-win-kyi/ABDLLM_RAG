# Technique C21: Specifying line spacing in CSS

## About this Technique

* [1.4.8: Visual Presentation](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/visual-presentation) (Sufficient)
* [1.4.12: Text Spacing](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/text-spacing) (Advisory)

This technique applies to CSS.

## Description

Many people with cognitive disabilities have trouble tracking lines of text when a block of text is single spaced. Providing spacing between 1.5 to 2 allows them to start a new line more easily once they have finished the previous one.

## Examples

### Example 1: Setting the element to 1.5 line height

In the style sheet set the characteristics of the element.

```css
body { line-height: 1.5; }
```

This sets the line height of everything in the body of the document to 1.5.
