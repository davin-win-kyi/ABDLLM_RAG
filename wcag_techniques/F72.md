# Technique F72: Failure of Success Criterion 1.1.1 due to using ASCII art without providing a text alternative

## About this Technique

This technique relates to [1.1.1: Non-text Content](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/non-text-content) (Failure).

This failure applies to any technology.

## Description

The objective of this failure condition is to avoid the use of [ASCII art](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-ascii-art) when a text alternative is not provided. Although ASCII art is implemented as a character string, its meaning comes from the pattern of glyphs formed by a visual presentation of that string, not from the text itself. Therefore ASCII art is non-text content and requires a text alternative. Text alternatives, or links to them, should be placed near the ASCII art in order to be associated with it.

## Examples

### Example 1:  ASCII Art chart without a text alternative

The following ASCII art chart lacks a text alternative and therefore does not meet Success Criterion 1.1.1. Note this failure example does in fact cause this page to fail, but you may [skip over the example](#tests).

## Tests

### Procedure

1. Access a page with ASCII art.
2. For each instance of ASCII art, check that it has a text alternative.

### Expected Results

* If check #2 is false, then this failure condition applies and the content fails this Success Criterion.
