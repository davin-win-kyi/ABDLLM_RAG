# Technique F30: Failure of Success Criterion 1.1.1 and 1.2.1 due to using text alternatives that are not
                    alternatives (e.g., filenames or placeholder text)

## About this Technique

This technique relates to:

* [1.1.1: Non-text Content](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/non-text-content) (Failure)
* [1.2.1: Audio-only and Video-only (Prerecorded)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/audio-only-and-video-only-prerecorded) (Failure)

This failure applies to all technologies.

## Description

This describes a failure condition for all techniques involving text alternatives. If the text in the "text alternative" cannot be used in place of the non-text content without losing information or function then it fails because it is not, in fact, an alternative to the non-text content.

## Examples

### Example 1

Examples of text that are not text alternatives include:

* placeholder text such as " " or "spacer" or "image" or "picture" etc that are put into the 'text alternative' location on images or pictures.
* programming references that do not convey the information or function of the non-text content such as "picture 1", "picture 2" or "0001", "0002" or "Intro#1", "Intro#2".
* filenames that are not valid text alternatives in their own right such as "Oct.jpg" or "Chart.jpg" or "sales\\oct\\top3.jpg"

## Tests

### Procedure

1. Check each text alternative to see if it is not actually a text alternative for the non-text content.

### Expected Results

* If check #1 is true then this failure condition applies and content fails the Success Criterion.
