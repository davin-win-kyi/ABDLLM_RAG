# Technique F48: Failure of Success Criterion 1.3.1 due to using the pre element to markup
                    tabular information

## About this Technique

This technique relates to [1.3.1: Info and Relationships](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/info-and-relationships) (Failure).

This failure applies to HTML.

## Description

This document describes a failure caused by use of the HTML pre element to markup tabular information. The pre element preserves only visual formatting. If the pre element is used to markup tabular information, the visually implied logical relationships between the table cells and the headers are lost if the user cannot see the screen or if the visual presentation changes significantly.

Instead, the HTML table element is intended to present tabular data. Assistive technologies use the structure of an HTML table to present data to the user in a logical manner. This structure is not available when using the pre element.

## Examples

### Example 1: A schedule formatted with tabs between columns

```html
<pre>
         Monday   Tuesday     Wednesday      Thursday         Friday
8:00-
9:00	          Meet with Sam
9:00-
10:00    		      Dr. Williams   Sam again        Leave for San Antonio
</pre>
```

### Example 2: Election results displayed using preformatted text

```html
<pre>

## Tests

### Procedure

1. Check to see if the pre element is used
