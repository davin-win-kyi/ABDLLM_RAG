This failure applies to all technologies.

## Description

Examples of text that are not titles include:

* Authoring tool default titles, such as
* Filenames that are not descriptive in their own right, such as report.html or spk12.html
* Empty text
* Filler or placeholder text

### Example 2

A site generated using templates includes the same title for each page on the site. So the title cannot be used to distinguish among the pages.
