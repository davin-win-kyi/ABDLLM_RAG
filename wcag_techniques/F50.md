# Technique F50: Failure of Success Criterion 2.2.2 due to a script that causes a blink effect without a
                    mechanism to stop the blinking at 5 seconds or less

## About this Technique

This technique relates to [2.2.2: Pause, Stop, Hide](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/pause-stop-hide) (Failure).

This failure applies to technologies that support script-controlled blinking of content.

## Description

Scripts can be used to blink content by toggling the content's visibility on and off at regular intervals. It is a failure for the script not to include a mechanism to stop the blinking at 5 seconds or earlier. See [Using scripts to control blinking and stop it in five seconds or less](../client-side-script/SCR22) for information about how to modify the technique to stop the blinking.

## Examples

### Example 1

The following example uses script to blink content, but the blink continues indefinitely rather than stopping after five seconds.

```html
<script>
  // blink "on" state
  function show(){
      document.getElementById("blink1").style.visibility = "visible";
      window.setTimeout(hide, 450);
   }
    
   // blink "off" state
   function hide(){
      document.getElementById("blink1").style.visibility = "hidden";
      window.setTimeout(show, 450);
   }

   // kick it off
   show();
</script>
...
<span id="blink1">This content will blink</span>
```

## Tests

### Procedure

For each instance of blinking content:

1. Determine if the blinking stops in 5 seconds or less.

### Expected Results

If #1 is false, then the content fails the Success Criterion.
