# Technique C12: Using percent for font sizes

## About this Technique

This technique relates to:

* [1.4.4: Resize Text](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/resize-text) (Sufficient when used for techniques for relative measurements)
* [1.4.5: Images of Text](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/images-of-text) (Advisory)
* [1.4.8: Visual Presentation](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/visual-presentation) (Sufficient when used with [G146: Using liquid layout](../general/G146))
* [1.4.9: Images of Text (No Exception)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/images-of-text-no-exception) (Advisory)

This technique applies to CSS.

## Description

The objective of this technique is to specify text font size proportionally so that user agents can scale content effectively. If a font-size is specified for the body element, all other elements inherit that value, unless overridden by a more specific selector.

## Examples

### Example 1: Percent font sizes in CSS

This example defines the font size for the strong element so that its text will always be larger than the surrounding text, in whatever context it is used. Assuming that headings and paragraphs use different font sizes, the emphasized words in this example will each be larger than their surrounding text.

```html
<style>
  strong {font-size: 120%}
</style>

<h1>Letting the <strong>user</strong> control text size</h1>
<p>Since only the user can know what size text works for them, 
it is <strong>very</strong> important to let them configure the text size.</p>
```
