# Technique G191: Providing a link, button, or other mechanism that reloads the page without any blinking content

## About this Technique

This technique relates to [2.2.2: Pause, Stop, Hide](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/pause-stop-hide) (Sufficient).

This technique applies to all technologies.

## Description

This is a general technique for allowing people who cannot use a page with blinking content to turn the blinking content off. [Conformance Requirement 1](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/conformance#conf-req1) allows for conforming alternate pages to be used to meet conformance. This technique is an example of that approach applied to success criteria 2.2.2.

It is important that the page without blinking content contain all of the information that was on the page with blinking content.

Note

Removing the content that was blinking from the page would only be satisfactory if the blinking content was redundant with non blinking content in the original page.

This technique can be used in combination with a style switching technique to present a page that is a [conforming alternate version](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-conforming-alternate-versions) for non-conforming content. Refer to [Using a style switcher to provide a conforming alternate version](../css/C29) and [Understanding Conforming Alternate Versions](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/conformance#conforming-alt-versions) for more information.

## Examples

* A page has blinking text at the top warning users that they should not submit the page without first registering. A link at the very top of the page reloads the page with the blinking text replaced with text that is styled to be highly visible but does not blink.
