# Technique F2: Failure of Success Criterion 1.3.1 due to using changes in text presentation to convey information without using the appropriate markup or text

## About this Technique

This technique relates to [1.3.1: Info and Relationships](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/info-and-relationships) (Failure).

This failure applies to all technologies that support images or presentation markup.

## Description

This document describes a failure that occurs when a change in the appearance of text conveys meaning without using appropriate semantic markup. This failure also applies to images of text that are not enclosed in the appropriate semantic markup.

## Examples

### Example 1: Using CSS to style the p element to look like a heading

The author intended to make a heading but didn't want the look of the default HTML heading. So they used CSS to style the P element to look like a heading and they called it a heading. But they failed to use the proper HTML heading element. Therefore, the Assistive Technology could not distinguish it as a heading.

```html
<style>
.heading1{
  font-family: Times, serif;
  font-size:200%;
  font-weight:bold;
}
</style>

<p class="heading1">Introduction</p>
<p>This introduction provides detailed information about how to use this ...</p>
```

Note

In this case, the proper approach would be to use CSS to style the H1 element in HTML.

### Example 2: Images of text used as headings where the images are not marked up with heading tags

Chapter1.gif is an image of the words, "Chapter One" in a Garamond font sized at 20 pixels. This is a failure because at a minimum the img element should be enclosed within a header element. A better solution would be to eliminate the image and to enclose the text within a header element which has been styled using CSS.

```html
<img src="Chapter1.gif" alt="Chapter One">
<p>Once upon a time in the land of the Web...</p>
```
