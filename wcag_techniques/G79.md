# Technique G79: Providing a spoken version of the text

## About this Technique

This technique relates to [3.1.5: Reading Level](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/reading-level) (Sufficient).

This technique applies to technologies that support links, audio formats.

## Description

Some users who have difficulty sounding out (decoding) words in written text find it very helpful to hear the text read aloud. This service can now be provided easily using either recorded human speech or synthetic speech. For example, there are a number of products that authors can use to convert text to synthetic speech, then save the spoken version as an audio file. A link to the spoken version can then be provided within the content. Cost depends in part on the quality of the voice used and whether the text is likely to change frequently.

* Spoken versions of short texts and static text content
* Spoken versions of text that changes

## Examples

### Example 1: A website for a government agency

The website for a municipal housing authority has a button on every page labeled "Read this page aloud." The user selects the button and the page is spoken by a synthetic voice.

## Tests

### Procedure

1. Check if a spoken version of the content is available.

### Expected Results

* Check #1 is true.
