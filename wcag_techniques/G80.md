# Technique G80: Providing a submit button to initiate a change of context

## About this Technique

This technique relates to [3.2.2: On Input](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/on-input) (Sufficient using a more specific technique).

This technique applies to content that includes forms.

## Description

The objective of this technique is to provide a mechanism that allows users to explicitly request changes of context. Since the intended use of a submit button is to generate an HTTP request that submits data entered in a form, this is an appropriate control to use for causing a change of context and is a practice that does not create confusion for users.

## Examples

### Example 1

Example 1: A submit button is used for each form that causes a change in context.
