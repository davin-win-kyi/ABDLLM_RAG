# Technique G9: Creating captions for live synchronized media

## About this Technique

This technique relates to:

* [1.2.4: Captions (Live)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/captions-live) (Sufficient, together with [G93: Providing open (always visible) captions](../general/G93))
* [1.2.4: Captions (Live)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/captions-live) (Sufficient, together with [G87: Providing closed captions](../general/G87) using a more specific technique)

This technique applies to all technologies that present audio visual information.

## Description

The objective of this technique is to allow users who cannot hear to be able to access real-time synchronized media broadcasts in the same [human language](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-human-language-s) as the original. It is more difficult to create accurate real-time captions because there is little time to correct mistakes or to listen a second time or consult someone to be sure the words are accurately reproduced. It is also harder to simplify or paraphrase information if it is flowing too quickly.

Real-time typing text entry techniques exist using stenographic and rapid typing technologies. Re-voicing speech-to-text (where a person listens to speech and then carefully re-voices it into a computer trained to their speech) is used today for telephone relay services and may be used in the future for captioning. Eventually speech-to-text with correction will be possible.

## Examples

### Example 1

A television studio uses a real-time captioning service to create captions for its evening news online.

### Example 2

A user watches an online seminar on their mobile device, including captioning provided through the use of Communication Access Real-time Translation (CART). The captions provided also benefit in-person participants who need captioning and can view the information on their own device.
