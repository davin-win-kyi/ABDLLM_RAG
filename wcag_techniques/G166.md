# Technique G166: Providing audio that describes the important video content and describing it as such

## About this Technique

This technique relates to [1.2.1: Audio-only and Video-only (Prerecorded)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/audio-only-and-video-only-prerecorded) (Sufficient).

This technique applies to all technologies that can contain video content.

## Description

Video-only content is inaccessible to people who are blind and to some who have low vision. Therefore, it is important for them to have an audio alternative. One way of doing this is to provide an audio track describing the information in the video in the [human language](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-human-language-s) of the page. The audio should be a common audio format used on the internet, such as MP3.

## Examples

### Example 1

A web page has a link to a video-only presentation of a spaceship landing on Mars. The link to the video is a picture of a spaceship. Near the video is a link to an audio file of a person describing the video. This would look something like the following code example in HTML.

```html
<a href="../video/marslanding.mp4">
  <img src="../images/spaceship.jpg" alt="Mars landing, video-only"
   width="193" height="255"/>
</a>
<p><a href="mars-landing-audio.mp3">Audio description of "Mars Landing"</a></p>
```
