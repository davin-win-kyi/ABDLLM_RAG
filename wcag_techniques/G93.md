# Technique G93: Providing open (always visible) captions

## About this Technique

This technique relates to:

* [1.2.2: Captions (Prerecorded)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/captions-prerecorded) (Sufficient)
* [1.2.4: Captions (Live)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/captions-live) (Sufficient, together with [G9: Creating captions for live synchronized media](../general/G9))

This technique applies to any synchronized media technology, even ones that do not support closed captions.

## Description

The objective of this technique is to provide a way for people who are deaf or otherwise have trouble hearing the dialogue in audio visual material to be able to view the material in the same [human language](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-human-language-s). With this technique all of the dialogue and important sounds are embedded as text in the video track. As a result they are always visible and no special support for captioning is required by the user agent.

NOTE: Captions should not be confused with subtitles. Subtitles provide text of only the dialogue, in a different [human language](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-human-language-s), and do not include important sounds.

## Examples

* In order to ensure that everyone can view their online movies, even if users do not know how to turn on captions in their media player, a library association puts the captions directly into the video.
* A news organization provides open captions on all of its material.
