# Technique G90: Providing keyboard-triggered event handlers

## About this Technique

This technique relates to [2.1.1: Keyboard](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/keyboard) (Sufficient using a more specific technique).

This technique applies to all technologies where content includes functionality.

## Description

The objective of this technique is to permit individuals who rely on a keyboard or keyboard interface to access the functionality of the content. To do this, make sure that all event handlers triggered by non-keyboard UI events are also associated with a keyboard-based event, or provide redundant keyboard-based mechanisms to accomplish the functionality provided by other device-specific functions.

## Examples

* Example 1: A drag and drop feature A photo application includes a "drag" and "drop" feature to allow users to re-order photographs in an on-line album for presentation as a slide show. It also includes a feature that allows users to select a photo and 'cut' and 'paste' the items into the list at the appropriate point using only the keyboard.
* Example 2: A reorder feature A web application that allows users to create surveys by dragging questions into position includes a list of the questions followed by a text field that allows users to re-order questions as needed by entering the desired question number.
