# Technique H32: Providing submit buttons

## About this Technique

This technique relates to [3.2.2: On Input](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/on-input) (Sufficient when used with [G80: Providing a submit button to initiate a change of context](../general/G80)).

This technique applies to content that includes form controls.

## Description

The objective of this technique is to provide a mechanism that allows users to explicitly request changes of context. The intended use of a submit button is to generate an HTTP request that submits data entered in a form, so it is an appropriate control to use for causing a change of context.

## Examples

### Example 1: A basic example of a form with a submit button

```html
<form action="/subscribe" method="post">
 <p>Enter your email address to subscribe to our mailing list.</p>
 <label for="address">Your email address:</label>
 <input autocomplete="email" id="address" name="address" type="text"> 
 <input type="submit" value="Subscribe">
</form>
```
