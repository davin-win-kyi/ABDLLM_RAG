# Technique F55: Failure of Success Criteria 2.1.1, 2.4.7, 2.4.13, and 3.2.1 due to using script to remove focus when focus is received

## About this Technique

This technique relates to:

* [2.1.1: Keyboard](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/keyboard) (Failure)
* [2.4.7: Focus Visible](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/focus-visible) (Failure)
* [2.4.13: Focus Appearance](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/focus-appearance) (Failure)
* [3.2.1: On Focus](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/on-focus) (Failure)

This failure applies to all content that supports script.

## Description

Content that normally receives focus when the content is accessed by keyboard may have this focus removed by scripting. This is sometimes done when designer considers the system focus indicator to be unsightly. However, the system focus indicator is an important part of accessibility for keyboard users. In addition, this practice removes focus from the content entirely, which means that the content can only be operated by a pointing device such as a mouse.

## Examples

### Example 1

```html
<input type="submit" onFocus="this.blur();">
```

### Example 2

```html
<a onFocus="this.blur()" href="Page.html"><img src="myImage.gif"></a>
```

### Example 3

```html
<a href="link.html" onfocus="if(this.blur)this.blur();">Link Phrase</a>
```

## Tests

### Procedure

1. Use the keyboard to verify that you can get to all interactive elements using the keyboard.
2. Check that when focus is placed on each element, focus remains there until user moves it.

### Expected Results

* If #2 is false then this failure condition applies and content fails the Success Criterion.
