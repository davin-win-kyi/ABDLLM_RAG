# Technique C20: Using relative measurements to set column widths so that lines can average 80 characters or less when the browser is resized

## About this Technique

This technique relates to:

* [1.4.4: Resize Text](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/resize-text) (Advisory)
* [1.4.8: Visual Presentation](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/visual-presentation) (Sufficient)

This technique applies to CSS.

## Description

The purpose of this technique is to ensure that CSS is used in a way that allows users to view content in such a way that line length can average 80 characters or less. This makes it possible for users with certain reading or vision disabilities that have trouble keeping their place when reading long lines of text to view and interact with the content more efficiently. This technique also allows for column width to grow wider as font sizes increase, which will reduce the possibility of clipping as the text size increases.

Note that this technique does not require authors to use CSS to limit the width of lines of text to less than 80 characters in the default view. Rather, the recommendation to use relative measurements in CSS layouts helps to ensure that authors do not set column widths in such a way that makes it impossible for users to view content with line lengths of 80 characters or less.

## Examples

### Example 1

In this example the div width is set in ems in the stylesheet.

```css
#main-content {max-width: 70em}
```

And the text block would be placed inside the div in the content

```html
<div id="main-content"> 
  <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing ...</p>
</div>
```

### Example 2

In this example the div width is set in percent in the stylesheet

```css
#main-content {width: 90%}
```

And the text block would be placed inside the div in the content

```html
<div id="main-content"> 
  <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing ...</p>
</div>
```
