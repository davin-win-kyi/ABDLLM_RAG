# Technique C24: Using percentage values in CSS for container sizes

## About this Technique

This technique relates to [1.4.8: Visual Presentation](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/visual-presentation) (Sufficient when used with [G146: Using liquid layout](../general/G146)).

This technique applies to CSS.

## Description

The objective of this technique is to enable users to increase the size of text without having to scroll horizontally to read that text. To use this technique, an author specifies the width of text containers using percent values.

## Examples

### Example 1

A newspaper has content in the middle of the window. The width of the container for the content is specified in page percentages, so that when a person with low vision increases the font size the text reflows inside the browser window at the new size and there is no need to scroll horizontally.
