# Technique F52: Failure of Success Criterion 3.2.5 due to opening a new window as soon as a new page is loaded

## About this Technique

This technique relates to [3.2.5: Change on Request](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/change-on-request) (Failure).

This failure applies when scripting is used to open new windows.

## Description

Some websites open a new window when a page is loaded, to advertise a product or service. The objective of this technique is to ensure that pages do not disorient users by opening up one or more new windows that automatically attain focus as soon as a page is loaded.

## Examples

Note

There are multiple methods by which this failure may be triggered. Two common examples that are supported differently in various versions of user agents are listed as examples below.

### Example 1: example commonly used to open new windows when pages are loaded

```javascript
window.addEventListener("load", showAdvertisement, true);
window.attachEvent("onload", showAdvertisement);
   
function showAdvertisement(){
  window.open('noscript.html', '_blank', 'height=200,width=150');
}
```
