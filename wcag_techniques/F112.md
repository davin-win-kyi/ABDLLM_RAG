# Technique F112: Failure of Success Criterion 2.2.2 due to using blinking content that lasts for more than five seconds without a mechanism to stop it

## About this Technique

This technique relates to [2.2.2: Pause, Stop, Hide](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/pause-stop-hide) (Failure).

This failure applies to blinking content created using CSS animations or client-side scripting.

## Description

Blinking content can be distracting and overwhelming for users, for example people with cognitive disabilities such as attention disorders. Content that automatically starts to blink or "flash", for five seconds or more, is presented in parallel with other content, and does not have a method to stop the blinking fails [Success Criterion 2.2.2](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/pause-stop-hide.html).

## Examples

### Example 1

A product listing page uses constantly blinking prices to draw attention to sale items. This fails the success criterion because users cannot control the blink.

## Tests

### Procedure

1. Examine the page for the presence of blinking content that starts automatically, is presented in parallel with other content, and lasts for more than five seconds.
2. If such content is present, check there is a method to stop the blinking.

### Expected Results

* If #2 is false, the content fails the success criterion.
