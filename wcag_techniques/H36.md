# Technique H36: Using alt attributes on images used as submit buttons

## About this Technique

This technique relates to [1.1.1: Non-text Content](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/non-text-content) (Sufficient).

This technique applies to content using image-based submit buttons.

## Description

For input elements of type image, the alt attribute of the input element is used to provide a functional label. This label indicates the button's function, but does not attempt to describe the image. The label is especially important if there are multiple submit buttons on the page that each lead to different results.

## Examples

### Example 1: An input element with an alt attribute

```html
<form action="/find" method="post" role="search">
  <label for="look-up">Find books<label>
  <input id="look-up" type="text">
  <input alt="Search" src="button.gif" type="image">
</form>
```
