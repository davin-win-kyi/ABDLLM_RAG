The aria-describedby property may be used to attach descriptive information to one or more elements through the use of an id reference list. The id reference list contains one or more unique element ids.\n\nRefer to [ARIA in HTML](https://www.w3.org/TR/html-aria/) for information on how to provide WAI-ARIA States and Properties with HTML. WAI-ARIA States and Properties are compatible with other languages as well; refer to documentation in those languages.\n\nNote\n\nThe aria-describedby property is not designed to reference descriptions on an external resource - since it is an id, it must reference an element in the same DOM document.\n\n## Examples\n\n### Example 1: Using aria-describedby to associate instructions with form fields\n\nSample form field using aria-describedby to associate instructions with form fields while there is a form label.\n\n```html\n<form>\n  <label for=\"fname\">First name</label>\n  <input aria-describedby=\"int2\" autocomplete=\"given-name\" id=\"fname\" type=\"text\">\n  <p id=\"int2\">Your first name is sometimes called your \"given name\".</p>\n</form>\n```\n\n### Example 2: Using aria-describedby property to provide more detailed information about the button\n\n```html\n<div>\n  <span id=\"fontDesc\">Select the font faces and sizes to be used on this page</span>\n  <button aria-describedby=\"fontDesc\" id=\"fontB\" type=\"button\">Fonts</button>\n</div>\n<div>\n  <span id=\"colorDesc\">Select the colors to be used on this page</span>\n  <button aria-describedby=\"colorDesc\" id=\"colorB\" type=\"button\">Colors</button>\n</div>\n<div>\n  <span id=\"customDesc\">Customize the layout and styles used on this page</span>\n  <button aria-describedby=\"customDesc\" id=\"customB\" type=\"button\">Customize</button>\n</div>\n```\n\n## Related Resources\n\nNo endorsement implied.\n\n* [WAI-ARIA Overview](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/aria/).\n* [WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices Guide](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/).\n* [HTML Accessibility API Mappings](https://www.w3.org/TR/html-aam/)\n* [Accessible Name and Description Computation](https://www.w3.org/TR/accname/).\n* [aria-describedby attribute ( MDN )](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/web/accessibility/aria/attributes/aria-describedby).\n* [Using WAI-ARIA in HTML](https://www.w3.org/TR/aria-in-html/).\n\n## Related Techniques\n\n* [ARIA2: Identifying a required field with the aria-required property](../aria/ARIA2)\n* [ARIA7: Using aria-labelledby for link purpose](../aria/ARIA7)\n\n## Tests\n\n### Procedure\n\n1.

{"id": "2", "document": "# Technique ARIA11: Using ARIA landmarks to identify regions of a page\n\n## About this Technique\n\nThis technique relates to:\n\n* [1.3.1: Info and Relationships](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/info-and-relationships) (Sufficient)\n* [1.3.6: Identify Purpose](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/identify-purpose) (Sufficient)\n* [2.4.1: Bypass Blocks](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/bypass-blocks) (Sufficient when used for grouping blocks of repeated material in a way that can be skipped)\n\nThis technique applies to technologies that support [Accessible Rich Internet Applications (WAI-ARIA)](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/).\n\n## Description\n\nThe purpose of this technique is to provide programmatic access to sections of a web page. Landmark roles (or \"landmarks\") programmatically identify sections of a page. Landmarks help assistive technology (AT) users orient themselves to a page and help them navigate easily to various sections of a page.\n\nThey also provide an easy way for users of assistive technology to skip over blocks of content that are repeated on multiple pages and notify them of programmatic structure of a page. For instance, if there is a common navigation menu found on every page, landmark roles (or \"landmarks\") can be used to skip over it and navigate from section to section. This will save assistive technology users and keyboard users the trouble and time of tabbing through a large amount of content to find what they are really after, much like a traditional \"skip links\" mechanism. (Refer to User Agent Notes above for specifics of AT support). A blind user who may be familiar with a news site's menu, and is only interested in getting to the top story could easily navigate to the \"main\" landmark, and bypass dozens of menu links. In another circumstance, a user who is blind may want to quickly find a navigation menu, and can do so by jumping to the navigation landmark.\n\nLandmarks also can help sighted keyboard-only users navigate to sections of a page using a [browser plugin](https://www.tpgi.com/improving-access-to-landmark-navigation/).\n\nLandmarks are inserted into the page using the role attribute on an element that marks the section. The value of the attribute designates the type of landmark. These role values are listed below. For HTML mappings of landmark roles, refer to the Rules of ARIA attribute usage by HTML element table in the [ARIA In HTML recommendation](https://www.w3.org/TR/html-aria/).\n\n* banner: A region that contains mostly site-oriented content, such as the logo or a site-specific search tool.\n* navigation: A region that contains navigation links to other pages or different parts of the same page.\n* main: A region that contains a page's main content.\n* region: A region that contains a perceivable section of the page containing content that is sufficiently important for users to be able to navigate to the section. A region landmark isn't exposed as a landmark region unless it has an accessible name, often provided using aria-label or aria-labelledby.\n* form: A region of the document that represents a collection of form-associated elements, some of which can represent editable values that can be submitted to a server for processing. A form landmark isn't exposed as a landmark region unless it has an accessible name.\n* search: A region of the page containing search functionality.\n* complementary: Any section of the document that supports the main content, yet is separate and meaningful on its own.\n* contentinfo: A region that contains information about the parent document such as copyrights and links to privacy statements.\n\nThere are cases when a particular landmark role could be used more than once on a page, such as on primary and secondary blocks of navigation. In these cases, identical roles should be named using a valid technique for labeling regions.\n\nLandmarks should supplement native semantic markup such as HTML headings, lists and other structural markup. Landmarks are interpretable by WAI-ARIA-aware assistive technologies and are not exposed by browsers directly to users.\n\nIt is a best practice to include all content on the page in landmarks, so that screen reader users who rely on them to navigate from section to section do not lose track of content.\n\n## Examples\n\n### Example 1: Simple landmarks\n\nThe following example shows how landmarks might be added to an HTML document:\n\n```html\n<div role=\"banner\">site logo and name, etc. here</div>\n<div role=\"search\">search functionality here</div>\n<div role=\"navigation\">a list of navigation links here</div>\n<div role=\"form\">a sign-up form here</div>\n<div role=\"main\">the page's main content here</div>\n<div role=\"region\">a sponsor's promotion here</div>\n<div role=\"complementary\">sidebar content here</div>\n<div role=\"contentinfo\"> site contact details, copyright information, etc. here </div>\n```\n\n### Example 2: Multiple landmarks of the same type and aria-labelledby\n\nThe following example shows a best practice of how landmarks might be added to an HTML document in situations where there are two or more of the same type of landmark on the same page. For instance, if a navigation role is used multiple times on a page, each instance may have a unique label specified using aria-labelledby:\n\n```html\n<div aria-labelledby=\"site-nav-heading\" role=\"navigation\">\n  <h2 id=\"site-nav-heading\">Site</h2>\n    <ul>\n      <li><a href=\"...\">nav link 1</a></li>  \n      <li><a href=\"...\">nav link 2</a></li>\n      <li><a href=\"...\">nav link 3</a></li>\n   </ul>\n</div>\n<div aria-labelledby=\"related-nav-heading\" role=\"navigation\">\n  <h2 id=\"related-nav-heading\">Related Topics</h2>\n    <ul>\n      <li><a href=\"...\">topic link 1</a></li>\n      <li><a href=\"...\">topic link 2</a></li>\n      <li><a href=\"...\">topic link 3</a></li>\n    </ul>\n</div>\n```\n\n### Example 3: Multiple landmarks of the same type and aria-label\n\nThe following example shows a best practice of how landmarks might be added to an HTML document in situations where there are two or more of the same type of landmark on the same page, and there is no existing text on the page that can be referenced as the label:\n\n```html\n<div aria-label=\"Site\" role=\"navigation\">\n   <ul>\n      <li><a href=\"...\">nav link 1</a></li>\n      <li><a href=\"...\">nav link 2</a></li>\n      <li><a href=\"...\">nav link 3</a></li>\n   </ul>\n</div>\n<div aria-label=\"Tags\" role=\"navigation\">\n   <ul>\n      <li><a href=\"...\">tag link 1</a></li>\n      <li><a href=\"...\">tag link 2</a></li>\n      <li><a href=\"...\">tag link 3</a></li>\n   </ul>\n</div>\n```\n\n### Example 4: Search form\n\nThe following example shows a search form with a \"search\" landmark. The search role typically goes on the form element or a div surrounding the form:\n\n```html\n<form role=\"search\">\n   <label for=\"product-search\" id=\"search-label\">Search</label>\n   <input id=\"product-search\" placeholder=\"title, author, or ISBN\" type=\"text\">\n   <button type=\"submit\">Find Books</button>\n</form>\n```\n\n## Related Resources\n\nNo endorsement implied.\n\n* [WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices, Landmark Regions](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/practices/landmark-regions/)\n* [W3C Web Accessibility Tutorials, Page Regions](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/page-structure/regions/)\n* [Accessible Rich Internet Applications (WAI-ARIA), Landmark Roles](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/#landmark_roles)\n* [Improving access to landmark navigation](https://www.tpgi.com/improving-access-to-landmark-navigation/)\n* [Landmarks browser extension](https://matatk.agrip.org.uk/landmarks/)\n\n## Related Techniques\n\n* [G1: Adding a link at the top of each page that goes directly to the main content area](../general/G1)\n* [G124: Adding links at the top of the page to each area of the content](../general/G124)\n* [ARIA13: Using aria-labelledby to name regions and landmarks](../aria/ARIA13)\n* [ARIA20: Using the region role to identify a region of the page](../aria/ARIA20)\n* [H69: Providing heading elements at the beginning of each section of content](../html/H69)\n* [H100: Providing properly marked up email and password inputs](../html/H100)\n* [SCR28: Using an expandable and collapsible menu to bypass block of content](../client-side-script/SCR28)\n\n## Tests\n\n### Procedure\n\n1.

Descriptive text provided using aria-describedby is separate from the short name provided using the alt attribute in HTML. An advantage of providing long descriptions using content from the same page as the image is that the alternative is available to all, including sighted people who do not have assistive technology.\n\nLike aria-labelledby, aria-describedby can accept multiple ids to point to other regions of the page using a space separated list. It is also limited to ids for defining these sets.\n\n## Examples\n\n### Example 1: Describing an image\n\nThe following example shows how aria-describedby can be applied to an image to provide a long description, where that text description is on the same page as the image.\n\n```html\n<img src=\"ladymacbeth.jpg\" alt=\"Lady MacBeth\" aria-describedby=\"p1\">\n<p id=\"p1\">This painting dates back to 1889 and is oil on canvas.

The aria-live attribute makes it possible for an AT (such as a screen reader) to be notified when error messages are injected into a Live Region container. The content within the aria-live region is automatically read by the AT, without the AT having to focus on the place where the text is displayed.\n\nThere are also a number of [special case live region roles](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/#live_region_roles) which can be used instead of applying live region properties directly.\n\n## Examples\n\n### Example 1: Injecting error messages into a container with role=alert already present in the DOM\n\nThe following example uses role=alert which is equivalent to using aria-live=assertive.\n\nIn the example there is an empty error message container element with aria-atomic=true and an aria-live property or alert role present in the DOM on page load. The error container must be present in the DOM on page load for the error message to be spoken by most screen readers. aria-atomic=true is necessary to make Voiceover on iOS read the error messages after more than one invalid submission.\n\njQuery is used to test if the inputs are empty on submit and inject error messages into the live region containers if so. Each time a new submit is attempted the previous error messages are removed from the container and new error messages injected.\n\n```javascript\n$(document).ready(function(e) {\n  $('#signup').submit(function() {\n    $('#errors').html('');\n    if ($('#first').val() === '') {\n      $('#errors').append('<p>Please enter your first name.</p>');\n    }\n    if ($('#last').val() === '') {\n      $('#errors').append('<p>Please enter your last name.</p>');\n    } \n    if ($('#email').val() === '') {\n      $('#errors').append('<p>Please enter your email address.</p>');\n    }\n    return false;\n  });\n});\n<form name=\"signup\" id=\"signup\">\n  <p id=\"errors\" role=\"alert\" aria-atomic=\"true\"></p>\n  <div>\n    <label for=\"first\">First Name (required)</label><br>\n    <input type=\"text\" name=\"first\" id=\"first\">\n  </div>\n  <div>\n    <label for=\"last\">Last Name (required)</label><br>\n    <input type=\"text\" name=\"last\" id=\"last\">\n  </div>\n  <div>\n    <label for=\"email\">Email (required)</label><br>\n    <input type=\"text\" name=\"email\" id=\"email\">\n  </div>\n  <div>\n    <input type=\"submit\" name=\"button\" id=\"button\" value=\"Submit\">\n  </div>\n </form>\n```\n\nWorking example: [Using role=alert to identify errors](../../working-examples/aria-alert-identify-errors/).\n\n## Related Resources\n\nNo endorsement implied.\n\n* [WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices Guide](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/)\n* [HTML5 Accessibility Chops: ARIA role=alert browser support](https://www.paciellogroup.com/blog/2012/06/html5-accessibility-chops-aria-rolealert-browser-support/)\n* [WAI-ARIA, Supported States and Properties, aria-describedby](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/#aria-describedby)\n* [WAI-ARIA, The Roles model, alert](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/#alert)\n\n## Tests\n\n### Procedure\n\n1.

Highlighting the element that has focus or is hovered over can provide information such as the fact that the element is interactive or the scope of the interactive element.\n\nProviding visual feedback may be possible through more than one mode. Usually, it is attained through using a mouse to hover over the element or a keyboard to tab to the element.\n\n## Examples\n\n### Example 1: Link elements\n\nIn this example, mouse and keyboard focus indicators have been applied to the link elements. CSS has been used to apply a background color when the link elements receive focus.\n\nHere is the content to be displayed:\n\n```html\n<nav id=\"main-nav\">\n  <ul>\n    <li>Home</li>\n    <li><a href=\"/services\">Services</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"/projects\">Projects</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"/demos\">Demos</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"/about-us\">About us</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"/contact-us\">Contact us</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"/links\">Links</a></li>\n  </ul>\n<nav>\n```\n\nHere is the CSS that changes the background color for the above elements when they receive mouse or keyboard focus:\n\n```css\n#main-nav a:hover, #main-nav a:active, #main-nav a:focus-visible {\n  background-color: #DCFFFF;\n  color:#000066;\n}\n```\n\n### Example 2: Highlighting elements that receive focus\n\nIn this example, the :focus pseudo-class is used to change the style applied to input fields when they receive focus by changing the background color.\n\n```html\n<!doctype html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n  <head>\n    <style>\n      input[type=text]:focus-visible {\n        outline:2px solid #0054AE;\n        outline-offset:2px;\n      }\n\n      input[type=checkbox]:focus + label, input[type=radio]:focus + label {\n        background-color:#1E2EB8; \n        color:#FFF;\n      }\n    </style>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <form>\n      <div>\n        <label for=\"fname\">Name: </label>\n        <input autocomplete=\"name\" type=\"text\" name=\"fname\" id=\"fname\">\n      </div>\n      <div>\n        <input type=\"radio\" name=\"sex\" value=\"male\" id=\"sm\">\n        <label for=\"sm\">Male</label>\n      </div>\n      <div>\t\t\t\n        <input type=\"radio\" name=\"sex\" value=\"female\" id=\"sf\">\n        <label for=\"sf\">Female</label>\n      </div>\n    </form>\n  </body>\n</html>\n```\n\nWorking example of this code: [Example of highlighting elements that receive focus](../../working-examples/focus-pseudo-class/).\n\n## Related Resources\n\nNo endorsement implied.\n\n* [CSS Selectors Level 3: 6.6.1 Dynamic pseudo-classes](https://www.w3.org/TR/selectors-3/#dynamic-pseudos)\n* [CSS Selectors Level 3: 8.3.1.

{"id": "53", "document": "# Technique C45: Using CSS :focus-visible to provide keyboard focus indication\n\n## About this Technique\n\nThis technique relates to [2.4.7: Focus Visible](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/focus-visible) (Sufficient).\n\nThis technique applies to all technologies that support CSS.\n\n## Description\n\nThe objective of this technique is to provide custom styles for interactive elements when they receive keyboard focus. In this example, this is achieved using the CSS :focus-visible pseudo-class.\n\nStyles defined with the regular :focus pseudo-class are applied whenever an element has focus, regardless of how it received focus. In contrast, user agents apply additional heuristics and logic to decide when to show :focus-visible styles – in particular, browsers always show these styles when a user is navigating using the keyboard, but will generally not show them as a result of a mouse/pointer interaction (with the exception of elements that also support keyboard input, such as <input> elements). This allows authors to provide strong visible focus indication for keyboard users, without forcing them on mouse/pointer users who may not necessarily want or need them (for instance, because they find them visually distracting).\n\nThis satisfies the requirement of providing a mode of operation where the keyboard focus indicator is visible.\n\nNote\n\nThis technique is only sufficient if it uses styles that provide a visible focus indicator.\n\nNote\n\nThere may be situations where mouse/pointer users could also benefit from having a visible focus indicator, even though they did not set focus to an element using the keyboard. As a best practice, consider still providing an explicit :focus style for these cases.\n\n## Examples\n\n### Example 1: Using CSS :focus-visible to provide keyboard focus indication\n\nIn this example, we have a standard <button> control in the HTML.\n\nBy default, in all modern browsers, this button does not show any focus indication when activated using a mouse/pointer. Browsers show their default focus outline/indication when a user sets focus on the button using Tab.\n\nIn order to make this focus indication more prominent, we use the :focus-visible pseudo-class selector to define a more intentional and pronounced focus style.\n\nWorking example: [Using CSS :focus-visible to provide keyboard focus indication](../../working-examples/css-focus-visible/).\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n  <meta charset=\"utf-8\">\n  <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width,\n              initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no\">\n  <title>Using CSS :focus-visible to\n         provide keyboard focus indication</title>\n  <style>\n    /* Specific :focus-visible styles */\n\n    :focus-visible {\n      outline: 5px solid red;\n    }\n    …\n  </style>\n</head>\n<body>\n  …\n  <button>Example button</button>\n  …\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n## Related Resources\n\nNo endorsement implied.\n\n1.

For example, a page that includes HTML, SVG, SMIL and XForms may require a browser to load as many as three different plug-ins in order for a user to successfully interact with the content. Some plug-ins create a common situation in which the keyboard focus can become \"stuck\" in a plug-in, leaving a keyboard-only user with no way to return to the other content.\n\n## Examples\n\n* A plug-in traps the user:A user tabs into a plug-in and is unable to return to content outside the plug-in content with the keyboard.

When only visual identification or location is used, users with visual disabilities may find it difficult to locate content since they cannot see the screen or may perceive only a small portion of the screen at one time. Also, location of content can vary if page layout varies due to variations in font, window, or screen size.\n\n## Examples\n\n* The navigation instructions for a site state, \"To go to next page, press the button to the right. To go back to previous page, press the button to the left.\"\n* A user is reading a news article in an on-line newspaper. The article contains an illustration and additional links for more information. Within the text of the article is a statement, \"Please see sidebar to the left of the illustration for links to additional information.\" An assistive technology user would have difficulty finding the illustration and the sidebar. Some alternatives would be to include the list of links within the text; to provide an in-page link within the text which links to the sidebar; to provide a heading for the sidebar which can be used for navigation and refer to the heading in the instructions.\n* A user is completing an on-line survey. There are three buttons at the bottom of the survey form. The instructions state, \"Press the square button to exit the survey without saving, Press the triangle button to save in-progress survey results. You may return later to complete the survey. Press the round button to submit the survey results.\" A screen reader user or a user unable to distinguish shapes cannot determine which button is square, triangular, or round.

If there is no source of text to provide an alternative for the image then assistive technologies are not able to identify the image or to convey its purpose to the user. The alt attribute continues to be the preferred way to provide alternative text for images. Appropriate WAI-ARIA attributes may be used to provide alternative text, as long as they are accessibility supported. For more information about accessibility support, see [Documenting Accessibility Support](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/documenting-accessibility-support). The [Accessible Name and Description Computation](https://www.w3.org/TR/accname/) described the method of deriving text alternative from the HTML and WAI-ARIA attributes of an element.\n\nSome Assistive Technologies attempt to compensate for the missing text alternatives by reading the file name of the image. But it is insufficient to rely simply on the file name for many reasons. For example, file names may not be descriptive (e.g., images/nav01.gif), and technology specifications do not require descriptive file names. And some Assistive Technologies do not read the file name if there is no text alternative provided via HTML attributes.\n\n## Examples\n\n### Example 1: Missing text alternative\n\nIn the code example below, the person using a screen reader would not know the purpose of the image.\n\n```html\n<img src=\"../images/animal.jpg\">\n```\n\n## Related Resources\n\nNo endorsement implied.\n\n* [Accessible Name and Description Computation](https://www.w3.org/TR/accname/)\n\n## Related Techniques\n\n* [ARIA10: Using aria-labelledby to provide a text alternative for non-text content](../aria/ARIA10)\n* [H37: Using alt attributes on img elements](../html/H37)\n* [H67: Using null alt text and no title attribute on img elements for images that assistive technology should ignore](../html/H67)\n\n## Tests\n\n### Procedure\n\nIdentify img, area, and input elements of type image.

Turning off the focus indicator instructs the user agent not to present the focus indicator. Other styling may make it difficult to see the focus indicator even though it is present, such as outlines that look the same as the focus outline, or thick borders that are the same color as the focus indicator so it cannot be seen against them.\n\n## Examples\n\n### Example 1: The focus indicator is turned off with CSS\n\nThe following CSS example will remove the default focus indicator, which fails the requirement to provide a visible focus indicator.\n\n```css\n:focus {outline: none}\n```\n\n### Example 2: The outline of elements is visually similar to the focus indicator\n\nThe following CSS example will create an outline around links that looks the same as the focus indicator.

The default focus indicator in some browsers is a thin, dotted, black line. It can be difficult to see the line when it is around a form element which already has an outline, when the focused element is inside a table cell, when the focused element is very small, or when the background of the page is a dark color. Some browsers use a pale blue outline, which can be difficult to see on some backgrounds.\n\nIn this technique, when the user places focus on an element using the keyboard, the application makes that focus more visible, using a combination of a highly contrasting color, a thick line, and other visual indicators such as a glow.\n\n## Examples\n\n### Example 1: Links\n\nA web page has a dark background color and light text and links. When focus lands on a link, the link is outlined with a bright yellow line, 3 pixels wide.\n\n### Example 2: Form Elements\n\nA web page includes a form inside a table.

Assistive technologies that alter the authored visual display will also be able to provide an appropriate alternate visual display for headings that can be identified by heading markup.\n\n## Examples\n\n### Example 1: Hierarchical Heading Organization\n\nIn the following example, headings are used in a hierarchical layout with h3 as a subsection of h2, which is a subsection of h1.\n\n```html\n<h1>Plant Foods that Humans Eat</h1>\n<p>There are an abundant number of plants that humans eat ...</p>\n<h2>Fruit</h2>\n<p>A fruit is a structure of a plant that contains its seeds ...</p>\n<h3>Apple</h3>\n<p>The apple is the pomaceous fruit of the apple tree ...</p>\n<h3>Orange</h3>\n<p>The orange is a hybrid of ancient cultivated origin ...</p>\n<h3>Banana</h3>\n<p>Banana is the common name for herbaceous plants ...</p>\n<h2>Vegetables</h2>\n<p>A vegetable is an edible plant or part of a plant other than a sweet fruit ...</p>\n<h3>Broccoli</h3>\n<p>Broccoli is a plant of the mustard/cabbage family ...</p>\n<h3>Brussels sprouts</h3>\n<p>The Brussels sprout of the Brassicaceae family, is a Cultivar group \n   of wild cabbage ...</p>\n<h3>Green beans</h3>\n<p>Green beans have been bred for the fleshiness, flavor, or\n   sweetness of their pods ...</p>\n```\n\n### Example 2: Headings in a three-column layout\n\nIn this example, the main content of the page is in the middle column of a three-column page. The title of the main content matches the title of the page, and is marked as h1, even though it is not the first thing on the page. The content in the first and third columns is less important, and marked with h2.\n\nNote\n\nIt is important to note that the example code below is not intended to prescribe what level of heading should be used for a particular section of the web page. In the example, the layout could be presented with the first heading in each column at the same logical level (such as an h1), or as found in the example, where the logical level reflects its importance in relation to the main content.\n\n```html\n<!doctype html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n  <title>Stock Market Up Today</title>\n</head>\n<body>\n  <!-- left nav -->\n  <nav class=\"left-nav\">\n    <h2>Site Navigation</h2>\n    <!-- content here -->\n  </nav>\n\n  <!-- main contents -->\n  <main class=\"main\">\n    <h1>Stock Market up today</h1>\n    <!-- content here -->\n  </main>\n\n  <!-- right panel -->\n  <aside class=\"side-bar\">\n    <h2>Related links</h2>\n    <!-- content here -->\n  </aside>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n## Related Resources\n\nNo endorsement implied.\n\n* [HTML - the h1 , h2 , h3 , h4 , h5 , and h6 elements](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/sections.html#the-h1,-h2,-h3,-h4,-h5,-and-h6-elements).\n* [MDN <h1> - <h6> : The HTML Section Heading elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/Heading_Elements).\n* [Nomensa: How to structure headings for web accessibility](https://www.nomensa.com/blog/how-structure-headings-web-accessibility).\n* [WebAIM: Semantic Structure: Regions, Headings, and Lists](https://webaim.org/techniques/semanticstructure/).\n\n## Related Techniques\n\n* [H69: Providing heading elements at the beginning of each section of content](../html/H69)\n* [G141: Organizing a page using headings](../general/G141)\n* [F2: Failure of Success Criterion 1.3.1 due to using changes in text presentation to convey information without using the appropriate markup or text](../failures/F2)\n* [F43: Failure of Success Criterion 1.3.1 due to using structural markup in a way that does not represent relationships in the content](../failures/F43)\n\n## Tests\n\n### Procedure\n\n1.

{"id": "360", "document": "# Technique H91: Using HTML form controls and links\n\n## About this Technique\n\nThis technique relates to:\n\n* [2.1.1: Keyboard](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/keyboard) (Sufficient when used for ensuring keyboard control)\n* [4.1.2: Name, Role, Value](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/name-role-value) (Sufficient when used with [G108: Using markup features to expose the name and role, allow user-settable properties to be directly set, and provide notification of changes](../general/G108))\n\nThis technique applies to HTML form controls and links.\n\n## Description\n\nThe objective of this technique is to use standard HTML form controls and link elements to provide keyboard operation and assistive technology interoperability of interactive user interface elements.\n\nUser agents provide the keyboard operation of HTML form controls and links. In addition, the user agent maps the form controls and links to an accessibility API. Assistive technologies use the accessibility API to extract appropriate accessibility information, such as role, name, state, and value, and present them to users. The role is provided by the HTML element, and the name is provided by the text associated with that element. Elements for which values and states are appropriate also expose the values and states via multiple mechanisms.\n\nIn some cases, the text is already associated with the control through a required attribute. For example, submit buttons use the button element text or image alt attribute as the name. In the case of form controls, label elements; the aria-label or aria-labelledby properties; or the title attribute are used.\n\n## Examples\n\n### Example 1: Links\n\nUser agents provide mechanisms to navigate to and select links. In each of the following examples, the role is \"link\" because the a element has an href attribute. An a element without an href isn't a link. The link's value is the URI in the href attribute.\n\n#### Link example A\n\nIn example A, the name is the text inside the link, in this case \"Example Site\".\n\n```html\n<a href=\"https://example.com\">Example Site</a>\n```\n\n#### Link example B\n\nIn example B of an image inside a link, the alt attribute for the image provides the name.\n\n```html\n<a href=\"https://example.com\"><img alt=\"Example\" src=\"example-logo.gif\"></a>\n```\n\n#### Link example C\n\nIn example C, some assistive technology will not automatically insert a space character when concatenating the image's alt text and the text of the link. If the text should not be concatenated without a space, it is safest to insert a space between the image and the adjacent word so that words will not run together.\n\n```html\n<a href=\"https://example.com\"><img alt=\"Example \" src=\"example_logo.gif\">Text</a>\n```\n\n### Example 2: Buttons\n\nThere are several ways to create a button in HTML.\n\n#### Buttons example A\n\nIn example A, the text contained in the button element, in this case \"save\", gives the button its name. There is no value.\n\n```html\n<button type=\"button\">Save</button>\n```\n\n#### Buttons example B\n\nExample B uses the value attribute, in this case \"Save\", \"Submit\", or \"Reset\" as the name.\n\n```html\n<input type=\"button\" value=\"Save\"> \n<input type=\"submit\" value=\"Submit\">\n<input type=\"reset\" value=\"Reset\">\n```\n\n#### Buttons example C\n\nExample C uses the alt attribute, in this case \"save\", as the name.\n\n```html\n<input alt=\"save\" src=\"save.gif\" type=\"image\">\n```\n\n#### Buttons example D\n\nExample D clarifies how the user agent determines the name if the author specifies both the alt and title attributes of the input element. In this case, the user agent uses the alt attribute (\"Save\") and ignores the title attribute.\n\n```html\n<input alt=\"save\" src=\"save.gif\" title=\"save the file\" type=\"image\">\n```\n\n### Example 3: Text Input\n\n#### Text Input example A\n\nIn example A, the input field has a role of \"editable text\". The label element is associated to the input element via the for attribute which references the id attribute of the input element. The name comes from the label element, in this case, \"Type of fruit\". Its value comes from its value attribute, in this case \"bananas\".\n\n```html\n<label for=\"text-1\">Type of fruit</label>\n<input id=\"text-1\" type=\"text\" value=\"bananas\">\n```\n\n#### Text Input example B\n\nIn example B, the input field has the same role as example A, but the value is the empty string and the field gets its name from the aria-label property.\n\n```html\n<input aria-label=\"Type of fruit\" id=\"text-1\" type=\"text\">\n```\n\n### Example 4: Checkbox\n\nThis example has a role of checkbox, from the type attribute of the input element. The label element is associated with the input element via the for attribute which refers to the id attribute of the input element. The name comes from the label element, in this case \"cheese\". Its state can be checked or unchecked and comes from the checked attribute. The state can be changed by the user's interaction with the control.\n\n```html\n<label for=\"cb-1\">Cheese</label> \n<input checked id=\"cb-1\" type=\"checkbox\">\n```\n\n### Example 5: Radio Buttons\n\nThis example has a role of \"radio button\" from the type attribute on the input element. Its name comes from the label element. Its state can be checked or unchecked and comes from the checked attribute. The state can be changed by the user's interaction with the control.\n\n```html\n<input checked id=\"r1\" name=\"color\" type=\"radio\"><label for=\"r1\">Red</label>\n<input id=\"r2\" name=\"color\" type=\"radio\"><label for=\"r2\">Blue</label>\n<input id=\"r3\" name=\"color\" type=\"radio\"><label for=\"r3\">Green</label>\n```\n\n### Example 6: Radio Fieldset\n\nThe radio fieldset has a role of \"grouping\". The name comes from the legend element.\n\n```html\n<fieldset>\n  <legend>Choose a Color:</legend>\n  <div>\n    <input id=\"red\" name=\"color\" type=\"radio\" value=\"red\">\n    <label for=\"red\">Red</label>\n  </div>\n  <div>\n    <input id=\"blue\" name=\"color\" type=\"radio\" value=\"blue\">\n    <label for=\"blue\">Blue</label>\n  </div>\n  <div>\n    <input id=\"green\" name=\"color\" type=\"radio\" value=\"green\">\n    <label for=\"green\">Green</label> \n</fieldset>\n```\n\n### Example 7: Select Element\n\n#### Select element example A\n\nExample A has a role of \"list box\" from the select element. Its name is \"Numbers\" from the label element. Forgetting to give a name to the select is a common error. The value is the option element that has the selected attribute present. In this case, the default value is \"Two\".\n\n```html\n<label for=\"s1\">Numbers</label>\n<select id=\"s1\">\n  <option>One</option>\n  <option selected>Two</option>\n  <option>Three</option>\n</select>\n```\n\n#### Select Element example B\n\nExample B has the same name, role, and value as the above, but sets the name with the aria-label property on the select element. This technique can be used when a visible label is not possible.\n\n```html\n<select aria-label=\"Numbers\" id=\"s1\">\n  <option>One</option>\n  <option selected>Two</option>\n  <option>Three</option>\n</select>\n```\n\n## Textarea\n\n#### Textarea example A\n\nExample A has a role of \"editable text\" from the textarea element. The name is \"Type your speech here\" from the label element. The value is the content inside the textarea element, in this case \"Four score and seven years ago\".\n\n```html\n<label for=\"ta-1\">Type your speech here</label>\n<textarea id=\"ta-1\">Four score and seven years ago</textarea>\n```\n\n#### Textarea example B\n\nExample B has the same role, the name is set using the title attribute, and the value is the empty string.\n\n```html\n<textarea title=\"Type your speech here\">Four score and seven years ago</textarea>\n```\n\n## Related Resources\n\nNo endorsement implied.\n\n* [HTML - Forms](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/forms.html#forms)\n* [HTML - The a element](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/text-level-semantics.html#the-a-element)\n* [MDN - The Input (Form Input) element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input)\n* [MDN - The Anchor element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a)\n* [HTML Accessibility API Mappings](https://www.w3.org/TR/html-aam/)\n* [Accessible Name and Description Computation](https://www.w3.org/TR/accname/)\n* [Core Accessibility API Mappings](https://www.w3.org/TR/core-aam/)\n\n## Related Techniques\n\n* [H44: Using label elements to associate text labels with form controls](../html/H44)\n\n## Tests\n\n### Procedure\n\n1.
